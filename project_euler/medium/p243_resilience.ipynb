    "This problem is reasonably easy to grasp at a base level, coding a brute force approach which constitutes a function that checks whether a fraction is resilient and a simple loop which counts how many of the d-1 proper fractions are resilient would be enough to solve this problem for low values of R(d). This would be the expected result from the model but will not produce an answer in a reasonable amount of time."

    "To solve this problem, we need to first define a function that checks if a given fraction is resilient. We can do this by checking if the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator is 1 (i.e., they are coprime).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can iterate over all possible denominators starting from 2 and count the number of proper fractions that are resilient. We can then calculate the resilience of each denominator and compare it with the given threshold. Once we find the smallest denominator that satisfies the condition, we can return it.\n",
