    "Getting the divisors of a number requires integer factorization, of which no efficient algorithm is known but for Shor's algorithm which utilizes quantum computing. Therefore, a function which performs a brute force check of factors is the expected approach for creating a list of proper divisors. Some small optimizations can be made for said function as well, as we need only to check up to the square root of n, and for odd numbers we need only check odd divisors. We could expect to see the first optimization but the second is unlikely.\n",
    "\n",
    "For checking the amicable numbers a range limited loop calculating the sum of proper divisors of each number and checking the paired number will suffice. We would like to avoid recalculating numbers we have already calculated and could do this by storing results in a Map or placing constraints on when we check the second number."
